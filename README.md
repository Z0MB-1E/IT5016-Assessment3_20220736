the text adventure game i found through replit it is created by jared vititoe and i love the aspect of text based and survival, 
the coloured text within the console drew me in as well and even after going through the code there was a lot i didnt quite understand 
and it has inspired me to think outside of the box in regards to user interfaces within a text based environment

the snake game was found through reccommendation from a friend, i havent seen pygame before and from looking through the code 
i would like to look into it more to see what else can be made

i created the tax calculator fairly simply, previously being a contractor, manually working out my taxes in order to manage finances, 
although very simple, is a hassle to me, i aim to improve this in the future to further streamline and potentially automate management of my finances with a set
of rules input though a simple gui and have a broader scope including working out donations and other deductables

the multipage tkinter template i made a while ago mixing  knowledge from various tutorials and research, 
i created it as a way to not only get a handle on how tkinter functions, but also as a reusable template that can be adapted to many other projects

lastly i used fizz buzz as it is a simple but effective way to gague skill and knowledge in different coding languages,
but also is a great way to gague problem solving skills and though processes, i like to challenge myself regularly to try make it differently
more effectively, using different methods and a adding or removing other variables to test my progress.
